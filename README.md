Documentation: "App.js"
Overview:
This document outlines the structure and functionality of "App.js", a Node.js application file that serves as the main entry point for an API. It is built using the Express.js framework for handling HTTP requests and MongoDB for database operations. The application provides endpoints for managing books and user authentication.

Dependencies:
dotenv: Version 16.4.5
express: Version 4.19.2
jsonwebtoken: Version 9.0.2
mongoose: Version 8.3.4
nodemon: Version 3.1.0
Configuration:
PORT: Default port is set to 3000.
mongoDb_URL: MongoDB connection URL with credentials.
Secret: Secret key for JWT token generation.

Middleware: Authentication required.
Response: Returns a JSON array of books.
POST /books
Description: Adds a new book to the database.

Path Parameters:
id: ID of the book to be updated.
Request Body Parameters: Book details to be updated.
Response: Returns a JSON object with a message indicating success or failure.
DELETE /books/:id
Description: Deletes a book from the database.
Middleware: Authentication required.

POST /user/signup
Description: Registers a new user.
Request Body Parameters:

password: Password of the user.
Response: Returns a JSON object with a message indicating success or failure and a JWT token for authentication.
POST /user/login
Description: Authenticates an existing user.

Verifies the token with the provided secret.
Grants access to the route if authentication is successful.
Additional Notes:
This application uses MongoDB for data storage.
User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens.
Error handling is done for internal server errors and authentication failures.
Modules: "books.js" and "user.js"
Overview:
These modules define the schemas and models for the "Book" and "User" collections in the MongoDB database. They are used for interacting with the respective collections.

"books.js":
Defines the schema for the "books" collection.
Schema Fields:
id: Numeric ID of the book.
title: Title of the book.
author: Author of the book.
desc: Description of the book.
books: Numeric field, purpose unclear.
Exports a Mongoose model named "Book".
"user.js":
Defines the schema for the "users" collection.
Schema Fields:
name: Name of the user.
username: Username of the user.
password: Password of the user.
Exports a Mongoose model named "User".
Conclusion:
This documentation provides an overview of the structure and functionality of the Node.js application implemented in "App.js", along with the schemas and models defined in "books.js" and "user.js". It outlines the API endpoints, middleware, dependencies, and configuration settings used in the application.
